# AI-Enhanced Button Press Data Tracker

## Overview
This project is a fun and interactive data tracker designed to log events through button presses. It visually responds with screen color changes and maintains tallies that are sent to a Google Sheet in real time. The system also records the date for each entry, enabling daily averages and trend analysis.  

The purpose of this tracker is to collect and visualize data around the school environment, making it a collaborative and educational project for students.

## Features
- **Button-Activated Logging**  
  Each button press changes the screen color and increments a tally.
  
- **Real-Time Data Sync**  
  Data is instantly sent to a Google Sheet via **Google Firebase**.

- **Daily Tracking & Averages**  
  Automatically tracks the day of each event, enabling calculation of daily averages.

- **Collaborative Use**  
  Designed for group participation, allowing multiple students to contribute.

- **Potential for Expansion**  
  Depending on available time, additional hardware components like electrical modules or 3D-printed enclosures may be added.
